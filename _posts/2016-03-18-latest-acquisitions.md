London got Mud

mud australia was founded in 1994\. The porcelain range, designed by Shelley Simpson, combines hand made processes, clean lines, colour palette and functionality. The end result is a product that neatly intersects a minimalist aesthetic with an artisan finish. Our porcelain happily fits in any interior, providing a timeless alternative to mass produced ceramic design.As a small business we strongly believe in the global values of craft and community. We actively build relationships with the people who buy, use and love our product.
